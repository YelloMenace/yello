# YelloMenace

Hey, I'm YelloMenace, preferably known as Yello >.< . I am quite new to coding but I'm not going to let that stop me from learning more about different languages!

### 👤 My Story (kinda)

I have had a love for computers pretty much since I could use one. But only about a year ago, when I started taking Computer Science, did I realise that I really enjoyed something about coding and programming. Currently, .html is as far as my knowledge goes but I'm hoping to expand that exponentially in the future! I really hope that I can go further in my coding/programming journey and hope that you reading this, will one day be affected by something I've made :D(in a positive way obc)

### 🏋🏼 My GOALS for 2023/24
